# Melanoma Detection

This repository presents an in-depth analysis of melanoma detection using machine learning techniques. Melanoma, a type of skin cancer, is a significant health concern globally. Leveraging deep learning algorithms, this project aims to develop a robust melanoma detection model to assist dermatologists in early diagnosis and treatment.

## Project Overview

This repository focuses on developing a machine learning model for the early detection of melanoma, a potentially deadly type of skin cancer. By analyzing dermoscopic images, the model aims to classify skin lesions and detect Melanoma.

## Data Description

The dataset comprises 2357 images of various oncological diseases, obtained from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).

The dataset includes images of the following diseases:
- Actinic keratosis
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Dermatofibroma
- Melanoma
- Nevus
- Pigmented benign keratosis
- Seborrheic keratosis
- Squamous cell carcinoma
- Vascular lesion

The images have been sorted based on the classification provided by ISIC. Each disease category contains a varying number of images, with melanoma and moles being slightly dominant compared to other classes.

## Approach

The project begins with comprehensive data preprocessing, including image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model performance. Augmentation techniques are employed to increase the dataset size, mitigate class imbalance, and improve model generalization. A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is employed for feature extraction and classification. During training, techniques such as dropout regularization may be applied to prevent overfitting. Model evaluation is based on metrics such as accuracy of the models.

## Findings

- The CNN model demonstrates promising performance in distinguishing between different classes of skin lesions.
- Data augmentation techniques effectively address class imbalance and improve model generalization.
- Evaluation metrics indicate high accuracy, suggesting such a model's potential for clinical application in melanoma detection.

## Conclusion

The developed melanoma detection model shows encouraging results, indicating its potential as a supportive tool for dermatologists in early diagnosis and treatment planning. Further refinement and validation on larger datasets are essential to enhance the model's robustness and ensure its clinical relevance.
